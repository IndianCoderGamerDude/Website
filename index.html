<left><font size="4"><p>Awarded with the title of 'Asia's Best Beach' by the TIMES magazine in 2004, Radhanagar Beach in Havelock Island with its turquoise blue waters and powdery white sands lives up to the moniker. Its vast shores of endless white grains stretch across 2 kilometres, making it a prime attraction of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

    Food stalls and vendors can be seen on the fringes of the shore, keeping travellers refreshed with the provision of fresh and delicious seafood as well as beverages. You can also book beach beds, parasols, and umbrellas while they spend hours merely lounging at this exquisite wonderland. Radhanagar Beach Andaman is just adjacent to Elephant beach, so you may find mahouts taking out their elephants for a joyride to the tourists. The beach is also secure with patrolling lifeguards ready for rescue.

            Neill Island is a part of the South Andaman Administrative District and belongs to Ritchie’s Archipelago in the Bay of Bengal. A part of the massive ocean separates it from Ross Island and Havelock Island, Tourists visiting Havelock often make a day-long trip to Neill Island.
            Perhaps the most endearing feature of this island is its three sandy beaches, namely Bharatpur Beach, Sitapur Beach and Lakshmanpur Beach. The forest cover has reduced considerably due to the cultivation of rice but a section in the north-west of the island is being preserved actively.
            The regions where the forest cover is lost has a couple of degrees or so higher temperature than the region with enough flora. Nonetheless, Neill Island is the major supplier of vegetables to most regions of the Andaman Islands.
            Due to its limited area, Neill Island can be covered with a simple walk. All three beaches are exquisite and extraordinarily clean and are well-connected to the mainland as well

The trek starts at a distance of 2km from Radhanagar Beach.
For those who are here to relax, the beach offers some exciting food and drink options while one lounges leisurely on the sands. One could also engage in other adventurous activities like bird-watching, trekking and kayaking. As this area is famous for its coral reefs, sea walking is a major activity undertaken by almost every visitor to this beach, making this one of the best beaches of India

                                            The Cellular Jail, also known as 'Kala Pani' is an old colonial prison situated in Port Blair, the capital of Andaman and Nicobar islands. Constructed by the Britishers during their colonial rule in India, the jail was used particularly to exile Indian political prisoners. It was used to house many notable freedom fighters such as Batukeshwar Dutt, Yogendra Shukla and Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.
The jail complex is now owned by the Government of India and it is recognised as the national memorial monument that showcases the life of prisoners during the British era. Cellular Jail stands as a prominent tourist attraction in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands where visitors can learn about its history and also enjoy a light show held in memory of all the prisoners who were imprisoned here.
Today, the Cellular Jail is a solemn reminder of all the struggles the Indian freedom fighters undertook while fighting for independence, and is an integral part of India's history.
