<center><font size="4"><p>The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are a union territory of India.The islands are in the Indian Ocean, in the southern part of the Bay of Bengal. The capital of this territory is the Andamanese town of Port Blair.
    It is made of two island groups - the Andaman Islands and the Nicobar Islands - separating the Andaman Sea to the east, from the Indian Ocean. These two groups are separated by the 10° N parallel, the Andamans lying to the north of this latitude, and the Nicobars to the south. The channel that separates ANI is the 10° degree channel. This islands have the only active volcano in India, Barren Island. These islands are also uninhabitated. It also has the lowest point in India, The Indira Point </p></font></center>

<left><font size="4"><p>Awarded with the title of 'Asia's Best Beach' by the TIMES magazine in 2004, Radhanagar Beach in Havelock Island with its turquoise blue waters and powdery white sands lives up to the moniker. Its vast shores of endless white grains stretch across 2 kilometres, making it a prime attraction of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

    Food stalls and vendors can be seen on the fringes of the shore, keeping travellers refreshed with the provision of fresh and delicious seafood as well as beverages. You can also book beach beds, parasols, and umbrellas while they spend hours merely lounging at this exquisite wonderland. Radhanagar Beach Andaman is just adjacent to Elephant beach, so you may find mahouts taking out their elephants for a joyride to the tourists. The beach is also secure with patrolling lifeguards ready for rescue.

            Neill Island is a part of the South Andaman Administrative District and belongs to Ritchie’s Archipelago in the Bay of Bengal. A part of the massive ocean separates it from Ross Island and Havelock Island, Tourists visiting Havelock often make a day-long trip to Neill Island.
            Perhaps the most endearing feature of this island is its three sandy beaches, namely Bharatpur Beach, Sitapur Beach and Lakshmanpur Beach. The forest cover has reduced considerably due to the cultivation of rice but a section in the north-west of the island is being preserved actively.
            The regions where the forest cover is lost has a couple of degrees or so higher temperature than the region with enough flora. Nonetheless, Neill Island is the major supplier of vegetables to most regions of the Andaman Islands.
            Due to its limited area, Neill Island can be covered with a simple walk. All three beaches are exquisite and extraordinarily clean and are well-connected to the mainland as well

                    With its brilliant coral reefs and alluring cyan waters, the Elephant beach is one of the locations that add to the beach paradise reputation of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. These waters are a prime destination for tourists wishing to engage in water sports like snorkelling, swimming, banana boat rides, speed boats and diving. There are two ways to reach Elephant Beach: Take a ferry from Havelock Jetty to Elephant Beach (1000 INR per person) or trek for half an hour with a guide (INR 500). The trek starts at a distance of 2km from Radhanagar Beach.
For those who are here to relax, the beach offers some exciting food and drink options while one lounges leisurely on the sands. One could also engage in other adventurous activities like bird-watching, trekking and kayaking. As this area is famous for its coral reefs, sea walking is a major activity undertaken by almost every visitor to this beach, making this one of the best beaches of India

                                            The Cellular Jail, also known as 'Kala Pani' is an old colonial prison situated in Port Blair, the capital of Andaman and Nicobar islands. Constructed by the Britishers during their colonial rule in India, the jail was used particularly to exile Indian political prisoners. It was used to house many notable freedom fighters such as Batukeshwar Dutt, Yogendra Shukla and Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.
The jail complex is now owned by the Government of India and it is recognised as the national memorial monument that showcases the life of prisoners during the British era. Cellular Jail stands as a prominent tourist attraction in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands where visitors can learn about its history and also enjoy a light show held in memory of all the prisoners who were imprisoned here.
Today, the Cellular Jail is a solemn reminder of all the struggles the Indian freedom fighters undertook while fighting for independence, and is an integral part of India's history.

<center><font size="10"><b><u>HISTORY OF THE ISLANDS</u></b>
    <br>
<center><img id="hist" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Japanese_running_to_Andaman_Islands.jpg"></center>
<center><font size="4"><p>The history of Andamans is still a mystery to many. No one actually knows when and how the first inhabitants came to the island. The earliest archeological evidence yet documented goes back some 2,200 years. However, genetic and cultural studies suggest that the indigenous Andaman people may have been isolated from other populations since the middle Paleolithic (old stone age). In that time, the Andamanese may have diversified into distinct linguistic, cultural, and territorial groups, now known as tribes.
The first empire to list the Andamans under its territory was the Maratha Empire. Rajendra Chola, one of the Chola dynasty kings, conquered the Andaman & Nicobar islands to use it as its strategic navy base against the Srivijaya Empire (located in Indonesia). They called the Andaman & Nicobar islands Tinmaittivu or the impure islands.
A major chunk of the known history, however, dates back to the post-colonial period. The history of organized European colonization began when the Danish settlers of the Danish East India Company arrived at the Nicobar islands on 12 December 1755. On 1 January 1756, the Nicobar Islands were made a Danish colony, first named New Denmark. But this colony did not last very long as most of the empire was wiped out because of the outbreaks of Malaria by 1848. It was only the British who can then be called the true colonizers of the Andaman & Nicobar island.
    
    In 1789, the British established their colony in Andaman & Nicobar Islands. But, the island was abandoned by the British in 1796; yet, the British resumed control over Andamans in the 19th century. During the 19th century as the Andaman and Nicobar Islands history maintains, the British used Andaman and Nicobar as a penal colony, which was named ‘Kalapani‘ or the Cellular Jail. The history of Andaman & Nicobar Islands proves that criminals convicted of a crime against the East India Company were sent to Andaman and Nicobar Islands, with a life sentence: the convicts were forced to live in exile in the Kalapani.
    During World War II, the islands were practically under Japanese control, only nominally under the authority of the Arzi Hukumate Azad Hind of Subhash Chandra Bose. Bose visited the islands during the war, and renamed them as "Shaheed-dweep" (Martyr Island) and "Swaraj-dweep" (Self-rule Island).



General Loganathan, of the Indian National Army was made the Governor of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. On 22 February 1944 he along with four INA officers—Major Mansoor Ali Alvi, Sub. Lt. Md. Iqbal, Lt. Suba Singh and stenographer Srinivasan—arrived at Lambaline Airport in Port Blair. On 21 March 1944 the Headquarters of the Civil Administration was established near the Gurudwara at Aberdeen Bazaar. On 2 October 1944, Col. Loganathan handed over the charge to Maj. Alvi and left Port Blair, never to return.[6]

Japanese Vice Admiral Hara Teizo, and Major-General Tamenori Sato surrendered the islands to Brigadier J A Salomons, commander of 116th Indian Infantry Brigade, and Chief Administrator Mr Noel K Patterson, Indian Civil Service, on 7 October 1945, in a ceremony performed on the Gymkhana Ground, Port Blair.But, with the end of British rule, i. e. after the Indian Independence, the ‘Kalapani’ gave way to a conglomeration of beautiful islands. It was in 1947 that Andaman & Nicobar Islands formed a part of the India Union.</p></font></center>

<font size="4"><p>The Great Andamanese tribe is settled presently on the Strait Island by the Andaman & Nicobar Administration. This was the largest tribe earlier before the establishment of Penal Settlement in Andaman Islands. Various diseases including influenza etc. took large toll and the population was reduced to present 43 individuals only. The Administration has provided  houses and raised Coconut Plantation for the upliftment of Andamanese. Further free ration including cloths is also being provided to them. As such, Andamanese are no longer a nomadic tribe. However, they do sometime go for hunting and fishing.

    The great Andamanese is also known for their brave History in the past where they fought with bows and arrows with the English men who tried to occupy their land. On 14th May 1859 great andamanese having a soldier strength of 400-600 people bravely fought the British soldiers who had  modern equipments, thus has its impression in the history as “The Battle of Aberdeen”. The Andaman Government setup a statue for these Brave Soldiers in the Sea Shore of Marina Park as a memorial as it brings the spark of first freedom movement in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The population of great Andamanese is only 43 as per the census 2001.</p></font>

    <font size="4"><p>Onges are one of the most primitive tribes in India.  The Onges are inhabiting the Little Andaman Island. This Hunting and Gathering tribe has also been settled by the Andaman & Nicobar Administration at Dugong Creek and South Bay on Little Andaman Island. Coconut plantation has been raised for the benefit of Onges Medical care, free ration etc.  are being provided t by the Administration. Onges go for hunting and fishing occasionally . The present population of Onges is 96 as per the census 2001.</p></font>

    <font size="4"><p>The Sentinelese tribe inhabits the small North Sentinel Island. They also are hostile like Jarawas to outsiders. The Contact Expeditions of Andaman and Nicobar Administration goes to the North Sentinel Island periodically. A break through was achieved when the Contact team of the Administration led by Shri S.A.Awaradi, former Director of Tribal Welfare could establish the first ever friendly contact with the Sentinelese on 4th January 1991. Since then the Sentinelese have accepted gifts from the Contact Party. However, the Sentinelese continue to be skeptical about the outsiders including the Contact Expedition Team.
        Sentinelese are the hunting, fishing and gathering tribe. They fish in the coastal waters with bows and arrows and hunt wild pigs available on North Sentinel island. Sentinelese have dug – out Canoe which is used to move in the shallow coastal waters. They do not have the oars and therefore Canoes are propelled with long poles. Sentinelese also build temporary huts in their camps. Sentinelese, both men and women do not wear cloths. The population of Sentinelese is 39 as per the 2001 census.</p></font>

    <font size="7"><u><b>JARAWAS</b></u></font>
        <center><img src="https://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/JARAWA-TRIBE.jpg"></center>
        <font size="4"><p>The Jarawas are inhabiting presently the Western coast of Middle Andaman and South Andaman Islands. They are hostile and, at times, enter into areas where the Bengali and other people have been settled by the Government. The Andaman & Nicobar Administration have started  the Contact Expeditions periodically to Jarawas to befriend them. The first friendly contact was made in 1974 and since then the Jarawas are not hostile to the Contact Team which go with gifts like Coconut, Banana and other fruits.

            Jarawas continue to be hunting and gathering nomadic tribe. They hunt wild pigs, monitor lizard with bows and arrows. Tips of the arrow is made of Iron. Unlike Onges and Andamanese, Jarawas do not use dogs for hunting. Men fish with bows and arrows in the coastal waters while women catch fish with basket. Molluscus constitute major part of their Pisces food. Jarawas collect fruits and roots including honey from the forest. They build temporary huts in their camps. They use crude rafts to cross creeks and streams. The population of Jarawas is 240 as per the census 2001.</p></font>
